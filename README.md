# Weeeeebsite stuffs

This page is not made for public use, but I upload the code to this page for people to see how it looks like behind the scenes.

## how
This page contains PHP so it is not possible to run in the average browser, it must be ran with a LocalHost or web server.
If you're willing to remove the PHP contents and rename the index to .html it should be possble to run in a normal browser.

For anyone curious, no, I did not use any special software or tools to generate/compile the CSS or HTML (excluding the PHP).
It is all written by hand, so pleeeeease help me fix problems, thank youuu.
