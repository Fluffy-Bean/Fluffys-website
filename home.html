        <h2>About meeeeeeeeeeee</h2>
        <image src="images/fluffy2.jpg" alt="Fluffy Bean on pink background" class="about_image">
        <div id="about_text">
          <p>Hello! I am <span id="fluffy_color">Fluffy Bean</span>, or Fluffy for short,</p>
          <p>I am a smart 16 year old who likes to learn new things, although I'm not that good at much. I like to program! I've been interested in it for a couple years, fist gained intrest in it around the age of 10, and decided to dive into it in 2019 as a part of school course and started to learn at home independently in 2021! So far I learned how to program in Python and now I am also learning HTML and CSS! I also tried my hands on other things such as blueprint code, for example Scratch. I also programmed physical hardware like MicroBits and LEGO EV3 and NXT. I tried programming on a Raspberry pi a couple years ago but did not have much time to play around with it, so hopefully soon I'll be able to get myself one!</p>
          <p>Computers! They interest me a lot, electronics overall really! Recently I managed to get myself enough parts to build myself a PC, yes and I built it with my own hands! I also like to fix things, like my phones or controllers and laptops too! Please get your stuff repaired instead of buying new shit! :P</p>
          <p>I also have other interests too, such as playing games! I like rhythm games such as <a href="https://beatsaber.com/" target="_blank", >Beat Saber</a> and <a href="https://www.spinrhythmgame.com/" target="_blank">Spin Rhythm XD</a>, but I also enjoy <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/" target="_blank">FS2020</a>! I should try to play more games though.</p>
          <p>Another interest I have in the outdoors (very contrary to my programming indoors self), I like going on hikes all around my local woods and hills with my friends, and sometimes I manage to get some nice photos on the way too! Nature interests me as it's not confusing like people, so if I'm out and about I'm most likely going to be climbing trees or running through fields!</p>
          <p>I like listening to music, I go everywhere with music. Without it I'd probably go insane... x3</p>
          <p>Writing is not a strong point, I am all over the place reading this back</p>
