			<h1>Fluffy's Swagger Website</h1>
			<p>This is supposed to be a descriptive intro line, but I don't feel like writing this</p>
		</section>

		<section id="summary" >
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Hi! I'm <span class="fluffy-colour">Fluffy Bean</span>. I'm a 17 year old who found himself on the internet one day and became a furry! (And a developer)</p>
		</section>

		<section id="interests" >
			<h2>My interests</h2>
			<p>I am very interested in computers from any era, mainly the software side of them. I always tinkered with them from a very young age, and broke many computers and laptops on the way, but that didn’t stop me! Look where I am now dad, it was worth it.</p>
			<p>Unsurprisingly that led me to using Linux, Arch btw, which gives me access to many more cool thingys to play around with like a proper terminal with no batch crap.</p>
			<p>I also enjoy listening to music, a lot of it, and which leads me nicely to my next part, Rhythm games!The main 2 titles I enjoy playing are Beat Saber and Spin Rhythm XD, but I also enjoy playing other games like Minecraft, The Witcher 3 and the Half Life and Portal series.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="experience" >
			<h2>Experience in programming</h2>
			<p>I have a decent understanding of PC operating systems and now also a start on networking with setting up my own server.</p>
			<p>I delved into computers from when I was very smol and started with Scratch (not BASIC like ya’ll older folks) and then progressed to Python in Secondary School where I started to also explore other possibilities.</p>
			<p>ince then I attempted many thingies like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Bash, C# and other stuffs!</p>
			<p>I got into Linux just about a year ago when writing this (29th June 22) and broke many things, but that got me into configuring a lot of software! Such as Rofi, Polybar, fish and even Discord, Spotify and Firefox!</p>

			<h2>System configuration</h2>
			<h3>Operating system</h3>
			<img src="images/sussywussy.png" alt="Screenshot of Linux desktop environment" loading="lazy">
			<p>My main operating system is Arch Linux, in this screenshot you can see a "rice" of Rofi and Polybar! <a href="https://github.com/Fluffy-Bean/dots">Which you can see here</a>!</p>
			<p>My secondary operating system is Windows 10 just for VR</p>

			<h3>Hardware</h3>
			<p>For my PC case, I'm using an NZXT H510 (white) covered with a bunch of stickers and magnets.</p>
			<p>But for whats inside is a bit more interesting. I am using a Gigabyte X570 AORUS ELITE motherboard, pared with an AMD 5 3600. Cooling that is a be quiet! Pure Rock 2.</p>
			<p>Thats with 16GBs (2x8) of DDR4-3600 ram from Corsair, with an Nvidia GTX1060 (6gb) Zotac AMP edition.</p>
			<p>Which is all powered by a Corsair 550W 80+ Gold power supply.</p>
			<p>For storage I am using a Hitachi Deskstar that has 2TBs of storage for my games and larger files. For my boot SSD I am using a Samsung 980 1TB M.2 NVMe.</p>

			<h3>Equipment</h3>
			<p>My keyboard is a Razer Blackwiddow X Chroma that has been through too much. To go with that I have a Logitech g502 mouse with a Hyena Agenda mouse mat.</p>
			<p>For my monitor I have a BenQ MOBIUZ EX2510. For VR I have a normal CV1 with 2 cameras.</p>
			<p>Headphones are very important to me, as I use them for hours at a time everyday and listen to a lot of music, so I got myself Steelseries Arctis 3 (only to be very dissapointed with the mic and build quality). I also enjoy playing some games with a controller so I have a modded Xbox One S controller.</p>

			<h3>Server</h3>
			<p>My server is a simple Zotac ZBOX-CI527.</p>
			<p>It still has the base 8GBs of ram and i5-7200U CPU. But I upgraded it with a 120GB SSD.</p>
			<p>And it is running a Proxmox server with many many LXC containers because why not :3</p>
