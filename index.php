							<h2> About Me </h2>
							<p class="paragraph"> Hi! I'm <span class="fluffyColour">Fluffy Bean</span>. I'm a 17 year old who found himself on the internet one day and became a furry! </p>

						<div id="interestsText">
							<h2> My interests </h2>
							<p class="paragraph"> Apart from the obvious, I am interested in computers, specifically the programming aspect of them and the freedom it gives me to express myself </p>
							<p class="paragraph"> I also enjoy using Linux (Arch btw) which gives me access to do things such as customise my entire system! </p>
							<p class="paragraph"> Another thing I enjoy doing is playing games, some of my favourite tiles are, The Witcher 3, Minecraft, Beat Saber and Spin Rhythm XD </p>
						</div>
						<div id="experiaceText">
							<h2> Experience in programming </h2>
							<p class="paragraph"> I have a decently wide range of knowledge on computers and programming </p>
							<p class="paragraph"> Since I was young I delved into computers head first, and breaking a lot on the way. I started with Scratch, then progressed to Python in Secondary School where I really started my programming adventure! </p>
							<p class="paragraph"> Since then I tried many programming languages and programming-related stuff, I currently know Python, HTML and CSS but am also learning PHP, C# and soon JavaScript </p>
							<p class="paragraph"> I also got into Linux since the start was rough with me breaking a terminal emulator, locking a harddrive and many others. Then after a few months Manjaro gave into my messing around and I broke Gnome Display Manager along with Gnome itself. Since then I've been using Arch (btw) and happily configuring Rofi, Polybar, fish and even theming Discord, Spotify and Firefox! </p>
